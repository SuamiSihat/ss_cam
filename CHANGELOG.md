## [1.9.2] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Conditional Brand Assets module with large cards for Colour Palettes, Asset Libraries, and Logos.

### Changed

- Job IDs now place their work-type code after the sequential number, for example `0001D` and `0001S`.
- Legacy prefix-format IDs such as `D0001` remain readable and migrate to the suffix format in application state.
- Sub-brand selectors now display the full registered business names while project folders retain concise codes.
- Project Management separates project/template inputs from generated location and subfolder structure.
- Search operates on project-folder names and loads the selected project's `README.md` and file list.

### Installer

- Brand Kit installation registers its asset path for conditional module discovery.
- Express and Custom installation retain the four-step component, configuration, licence, and report flow.
- Brand Kit options are skipped when Brand Kit is not selected.
- Uninstall controls remain hidden when no Creative Project Management installation is detected.
